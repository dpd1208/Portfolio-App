                    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Daniel Duffy. I am currently residing in Denver, CO by way of Dallas, TX. Dallas was where I was born and raised, and I lived there up until I moved to Austin, TX to attend the University of Texas at Austin. There I received a B.A. in Economics, a certificate in European studies, and a minor in Latin. After school, I worked in customer service and project management at a mortgage company. After moving to Denver, I received a Scrum Product Owner certification, left my previous job, and took a product owner position at Sling TV.</p>

              <div class="col-md-12" style=margin-top:1em;>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing classical guitar, which I recently got back into after about a 15 year hiatus. I take lessons weekly and practice every day. I play tennis and enjoy maintaining an active lifestyle. Fortunately, that is not too difficult here in Colorado. I have two one-year-old dogs to help in that regard as well. We like to go on hikes, to dog parks, and camping trips whenever time allows.</p>
                <p>Time, however, has now become a valuable resource now that I have enrolled in an immersive coding bootcamp at the University of Denver. Despite that, I am excited to learn the skills offered in the course. I am eager to build up my knowledge of different languages and frameworks, and have opportunities to practice and improve these skills in a professional setting. </p>
